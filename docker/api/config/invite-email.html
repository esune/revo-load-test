  This proof of concept is facilitated by the Digital ID and Authentication
  Council of Canada. The purpose of this proof of concept is to provide an
  example demonstration of how digital id for verified persons could work as set
  out in the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework.
</p>
<p>
  There are three steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Setup by installing a mobile app (personal agent) and completing other
    prerequisite activities
  </li>
  <li>
    Obtain your proof of concept digital for a verified person from the BC POC
    issuing service
  </li>
  <li>
    Use your digital ID at one or more of the proof of concept demonstration
    services that have been provided by participating DIACC members
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Step 1: Setup
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    You must have an active login account from one of the following:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Github account, please populate the name fields of your github account
        profile -
        <a href="https://github.com/">Click here to sign for a free account</a>
      </li>
      <li>Other options are TBD...</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Install a smartphone app that you will use as your personal agent for
    receiving, holding, and sharing verifiable credentials that are issued to
    you. Please install one of the following:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Streetcred, currently only for iPhone or iPad. Please make special note
        of the extra details for this step since the demo will not work unless
        you follow the app setup instructions
        <a
          href="https://github.com/bcgov/issuer-kit/blob/master/docs/GettingApp.md"
          >here</a
        >.
      </li>

      <li>
        Other agents are TBD and are expected to be created by POC participants.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Step 2: Obtain your proof of concept digital ID for verified person
</p>
<p>
  This step works best if you have an additional device such as a laptop or
  tablet that can display the screens for the issuing service.
  <b
    >Using your laptop or tablet click the following link to start the process
    for issuing your digital ID for verifiable person:</b
  >
</p>
<p>
  <b><a href="${inviteUrl}">${inviteUrl}</a></b>
</p>
<p>
  Login using your github account and authorize the invitation service to
  connect to your account.
</p>
<p>
  You can use this link multiple times to allow for demonstrations you may want
  to do. If you find that the link has expired, please request a new invitation
  by sending an email to
  <a href="mailto:${sender}">${sender}</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Step 3: Use your proof of concept digital ID at proof of concept demonstration
  services.
</p>
<p>
  Currently the following services are available:
</p>
<p>
  We have found it works best if you use a second device such as a laptop or
  tablet for running these demo services. Please close and restart your browser
  to be sure that the github login is cleared away before running the demo
  services.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Demo Test Service - from your laptop or tablet click on the following link:
    <a href="https://csb-audio.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/"
      >https://csb-audio.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/</a
    >. After the page loads click the button for verifiable credential and scan
    the QR code with your personal agent app that you installed in Step 1: Setup
    above.
  </li>

  <li>
    Others demo services are TBD with expectation that POC participants will
    provide examples.
  </li>
</ol>
